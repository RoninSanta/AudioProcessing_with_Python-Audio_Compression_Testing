# Audio Processing with Python - Rice Compression
Testing the Rice audio compression algorithm at how effective it is in reducing the final audio file size. 
RICE algorithm is a compression method for lossless data compression based on curve fitting technique.
- The program reads the wav file as byte object, where each byte is an integer ranging from 0-255.
- Rice is used to compress the file into a text format, hopefully it can successfully reduce in file size
